Voxelization of semantic segmented images is a great way to add a 3D component
to 2D images. It makes the objects stand out without the unnatural edge
contours and weird coloration, and enhances their role. Voxelization also has a
whimsical effect on images by playing with geometry and leading towards a more
"normal" representation - after all, we live in a 3D space.
