## Full-body Anime Generation at 1024x1024 with Progressive Structure-conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (2018)

{{< youtube bIi5gSITK0E >}}

We show examples of a variety of anime characters and animations at 1024x1024
resolution generated by Progressive Structure-conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (PSGAN). 1. We first generate many anime characters using
our network from random latent variables and create new characters by
interpolating them. 2. Next we give continuous pose sequence information to the
network to generate an animation video for each character. In this video we
repeat 1 and 2 several times.

## Adding Action to Full-body Anime Characters with Progressive Structure-conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (2018)

We show examples of a variety of anime characters and animations at 1024x1024
resolution generated by Progressive Structure-conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (PSGAN). By fixing the latent variables (representing
character visuals) and giving continuous pose sequences to PSGAN, we can
generate an animation for each character.
