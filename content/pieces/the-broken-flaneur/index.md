What's the point of flanerie if there's nothing to see? Technology has the
power to disappear the world in front of our eyes. *The Broken Flaneur* is a
short film shot and produced in less than 24 hours with special effects that
are enabled by a generative convolutional neural network. The neural network
detects objects in images, removes the objects, and replaces the objects with
what the computer imagines is behind the object.
