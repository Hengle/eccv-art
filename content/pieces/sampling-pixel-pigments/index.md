The project interrogates post-digital representation, materialism and form
through an investigation of data as substance using the sampling of the
already-made. Through the employment of iterative photographic scanning as well
as data and image processing as an alternative means of generating geometry,
the project breaks away from both direct and computational euclidean modelling
logic. Exploring this paradigmatic shift away from the monolithicity of
conventional linear design and production protocols demands a speculatory study
of new modes of vision and extrapolating data. The project establishes a
non-hierarchical looping workflow that navigates between the physical and the
digital through the deployment of new techniques for seeing, revealing,
interpreting, and compositing as devices for design. These techniques enable us
to intervene in the selection and conversion of data in the sampling process,
allowing for alternative methods for reconstructing objects that are not
concerned with fidelity. In place of any notions of translation, the project
adheres to our contemporary culture of appropriation, copying and reproduction
and exploits the discrepancies and gaps in the sampling process. It is a
process that adopts the dirty, noisy, incomplete and imperfect in the
application of techniques, composition and aesthetics.
