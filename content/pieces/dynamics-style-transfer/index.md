Through the use of Artificial Intelligence, a computational model
(Convolutional Neural Network) is trained to learn the motion patterns of the
waterfall (top-center) and the textural appearance of the waterfall painting
(top-left) in order to synthesize a merged result (top-right and bottom) which
consists of the appearance of the waterfall painting and the motion of the
waterfall. Thus bringing the still image to life.
