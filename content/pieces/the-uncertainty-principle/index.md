*The Uncertainty* Principle consists of videos and an interactive application
about information and uncertainty in the domain of image analysis. The works
were produced by applying a set of *2D Gabor filters* to still and moving images.
Gabor filters identify various kinds of edges -- horizontal, vertical, and
diagonal – by responding to specific visual frequencies in an image.

One video, entitled *Rain*, was made by recognizing rain streaks in the opening
sequence of Wong Kar-Wai's film *The Grandmaster*. Used in combination with
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), the Gabor filters responded to the
visual frequencies that correspond to vertical edges on the image and removed
most other details in the sequence. Empty space between rain streaks suggests
the bodies of the fighters. The human figure is absent yet somehow present,
referencing the role of empty space in Chinese philosophy and visual art. The
original movie soundtrack involved a highly obtrusive pounding music, mixed
with effects and diegetic sounds. We also used NNMF for blind audio source
separation, and then manually removed those tracks that contained music,
preserving only the diegetic sounds.

A second video, *Folds*, was made by repeatedly applying a single Gabor filter to
a short segment from Ingmar Bergman’s film *Persona*. The scene involves a boy
moving on a bed, and the filters highlight the visual movement of the folds on
the bedsheet. The repetitive structure of the video cues the viewer to pay
close attention, both to the texture of the image and to the distinctive
effects of the different edge-detectors.

The interactive application allows people to explore and experiment with the
application of different filters to images in a database. The interactor can
choose which filter to apply, and observe the resulting visual description of
the image.

The work is an example of self-reflexive technology. A technology, in this case
the Gabor filters, is used not merely as a tool but as a formative context.
