*The Uncertainty Principle* consists of videos and an interactive application
about information and uncertainty in the domain of image analysis.

The various elements of the work are produced by applying certain filters,
known as 2D Gabor filters, to images. Gabor filters identify various kinds of
edges -- horizontal, vertical, and diagonal -– by responding to specific visual
frequencies in an image.

# Videos

The following two videos were made using Gabor filters. (It is recommended that
the videos should be viewed in Vimeo using full-screen and in a relatively dark
environment). The first video illustrates one possible function of the Gabor
filters, whereas the second video is more self-reflexive, and calls attention
to the filters themselves as artistic media. The first video has sound but the
second is silent.

The first video was made by identifying rain streaks in the opening sequence of
Wong Kar-Wai's film *The Grandmaster*. The Gabor filters helped to detect visual
frequencies corresponding to vertical edges on the image. Most other details in
the sequence were removed.

The second video was made by repeatedly processing a short segment from Ingmar
Bergman’s film *Persona* (1966) using different Gabor image filters individually
or in combination. The results are visualized by highlighting those parts of
the image with a high response to the filter being applied, while darkening
low-response pixels.

The repetitive structure of the video is meant to encourage viewers to pay
close attention, both to the texture of the image and to the distinctive
effects of the different edge-detectors. Whereas mainstream narrative cinema
encourages the viewer to focus on what happens next, this project draws
attention to the details of the individual frame.
