The neural collage '*When Schwitters met Trump*' responds to the angst of our
time just as its historical and political references play with each other
across ideological and temporal eternities of striated histories. An image of
current American President Donald Trump signing one of a number of mysterious
but publicly ostentatious executive orders was sampled from the information
stream of the world wide web and computationally blended with the compositional
sensibility of Kurt Schwitters' revolutionary *Das Und-bild* using neural network
'style-transfer' as a starting point, proposing that in the mash-up of
artificial and questionable intelligence 'everything has broken down and new
things have to be made out of the fragments' (Kurt Schwitters).

Growing out of my work in interactive abstract narrative, '*When Schwitters met
Trump*' reflects my concern with the divisionism that arises out of the
juxtaposition of subjective truths and fake news; a world of liminal existence,
uncertainty, and irresolution, which is nonetheless encoded and controlled.

As an abstract painter studying the cognitive science and psychology of
creative process, I find the fragmentation and emergent forms offered by a
global culture of disenfranchisement to be a rich field of unexplored
imperatives. Whereas Schwitters tried to make sense of a shattered world by
layering and composing it's refuse, today the fragments are pre-made by the
machine, emerging unrecognized at birth, the products of an internalized
algorithmic shattering spewed out with mathematical precision, disrupting our
organic slumber and consumed 'ubiquitously', bringing a revolution that we do
not even recognize until it consumes us â€“ man remade in the image of machine. I
call this process 'the algorithmic pursuit of the mental image,' or, '*neural
collage.*'
