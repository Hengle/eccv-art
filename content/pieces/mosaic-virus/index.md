Drawing historical parallels from “tulip-mania” that swept across
Netherlands/Europe in the 1630s to the speculation currently ongoing around
crypto-currencies, this video work is generated by an artificial intelligence
(AI). It shows a tulip blooming, an updated version of a Dutch still life for
the 21st century. The appearance of the tulip is controlled by bitcoin price.
“Mosaic” is the name of the virus that causes the stripes in a petal which
increased their desirability and helped cause the speculative prices during the
time. In this piece, the stripes depend on the value of bitcoin, changing over
time to show how the market fluctuates.
