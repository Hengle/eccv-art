The *Gestus* project consists of a custom software that analyzes the movements
of source videos in a database, identifying sequences that contain similar
micro- movements and rendering them side by side. The current version uses
source material drawn from Louis Feuillade’s 1916 film *Judex*. The film was
shown in cinemas as a serial with 12 episodes, a prologue, and a brief
epilogue. Each episode has an average length of less than half an hour. The
total running time of the film is 300 minutes.

The work mainly exists as a single-channel video installation. The image is
organized as a grid with nine cells. The source film is shown without
interruptions in the central cell. The software identifies eight shots, all from
*Judex*, whose movement (speed and direction) resembles the segment currently
in the center and shown in the other eight cells.

An early version of the work, *Gestus: Judex*, was first presented in ISEA 2011
and exhibited at the School of Creative Media of the City University of Hong
Kong in 2012. It has been subsequently shown in various festivals around the
world. *Gestus Redux* (2018) is a thoroughly revised version of the work,
including a new color scheme designed especially for this work.
