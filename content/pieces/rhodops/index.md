Rhodops is a progressively grown generative adversarial network named after
rhodopsin, a photoreceptor protein found in the eyeâ€™s cones which is receptive
to brightness. It was trained on a dataset of images generated by multiple
phases of recombinant style transfers. First, images were generated with 1 - 5
style images drawn randomly from a set of about 70 selected images. Once all
the style images were represented in the set, generated images were fed back to
the algorithm as content and style images. This process was repeated multiple
times with different variations of drawing content and style images from each
set until there were around 700 total generated images. These were enlarged,
cropped into tiles, rotated, inverted, and mirrored to create a larger dataset
for the GAN to learn from. Finally, after 2 weeks of training, looping videos
were generated. Latent vectors fed to the generator for these videos were
either random smoothed noise interpolations or paths played in with MIDI knobs
in realtime at 15 fps, then smoothed into loops and interpolated to 60 frames
per second.
