Parag K. Mital, Refik Anadol, and Refik Anadol Studio together with the LA
Philharmonic explore 27 TB of the last 100 years of LA Philharmonic’s
performance history. Using numerous generative models trained on both the audio
and images in the archive, they explore what it looks and sounds like to
journey through this archive. These fragments form a part of a larger
performance and exhibition led by Director Refik Anadol, where they will be
projected onto the steel skin of Walt Disney Concert Hall to mark the start of
the LA Phil’s centennial season in September 2018. Inside, in the Ira Gershwin
Gallery, visitors will interact with this digitally processed history. Far from
an ordinary timeline, this work will capture the non-linear, interconnected
totality of the LA Phil’s history in a way no human mind could.
