We live in a time in which more images are taken by and for machines than by
human beings. The way they see and construct the world has real implications.

*Ways of Seeing* is an immersive experience in which you can perform the role
of different machines and explore the world through their eyes. Wandering
through the city as a smartphone constantly looking for facial features, the
world appears as a flickering, triangulated accumulation of vectors.
Constructing the environment as a giant point cloud, an autonomous car attempts
to navigate through the streets. At night, a drone detects the body heat of the
cityâ€™s inhabitants with its infrared sensors.


This is a game environment to engender forms of empathy and understanding for
how machines construct the world. By clicking on different subject positions
you are able to switch between different cameras, different algorithms and
ultimately different ways of seeing.
