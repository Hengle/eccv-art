*Pictures of \*\*\* Girls in Synthesis*, is a machine that creates live,
visual, poetry. The machine reads, or listens to poetry in a variety of
languages. It synthesizes in real-time, visual images illustrating its
understanding and interpretation of the text. This is done using
state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for speech-to-text, language
translation, and the [AttnGAN](arxiv.org/abs/1711.10485) for text-to-image
synthesis. While the results are far from photorealistic, we get images of
surrealistic quality, containing colors, shapes, textures, patterns and objects
related to the words and their context, and creating a poetic experience. This
project was created in a 30-hour hackathon, at Geekcon-Art Hamidrasha 2018.
